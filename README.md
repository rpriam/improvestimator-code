Abstract: The mean estimators with ratio depend on multiple auxiliary variables and unknown parameters in a finite population setting. We propose a new generalized approach with matrices for modeling the mutivariate mean estimators with two auxiliary variables. Our approach brings naturally a graphical analysis for comparing mean estimators.

Warning: This method allows to demonstrate visually if any experiment in ratio estimator is mistaken and/or (highly) biased, hence this should not be used for checking an estimator with data afterwards.
